\title{Summary of BLP Model Outputs}
\usage{
BLPsummary(BLP_output, affected)
}
\arguments{
\item{BLP_output}{A list containing the output of BLP_eventtimes}

\item{affected}{A character vector of the names of the variables included in the BLP model
analysis.}
}
\value{
A matrix where each row corresponds to an event time and each column represents
the coefficient or standard error of a variable. The matrix includes columns for both
coefficients and standard errors for each variable including the intercept.
}
\description{
This function generates a summary table for the output of BLP_eventtimes
model analyses. It compiles the coefficients and their standard errors for each variable
across different event times into a single matrix.
}
\examples{
# Assuming BLP_output and affected are predefined:
summary_matrix <- BLPsummary(BLP_output, affected)
print(summary_matrix)

}
